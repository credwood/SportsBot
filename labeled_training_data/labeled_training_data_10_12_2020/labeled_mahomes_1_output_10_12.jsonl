I really do.

I hope he is our guy. And we get better. Hard to think it right now\\nHunnewellJason: @giantsherbsquad @COOLLANEHERO Rodgers and Mahomes went to playoff teams and sat behind an established starter. Wilson went to a Seahawks team coming off a 7-9 season and had some success already. A big leap Lawrence going to whatever suck team picks him #1. I also hope Jones is the guy and he succeeds!\\ngiantsherbsquad: @HunnewellJason @COOLLANEHERO But those two guys have played w shorty line play and avg skill players and continue to win.
