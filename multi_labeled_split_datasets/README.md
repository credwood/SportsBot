# Fine-tuning Data

To read in the data of a specific file:

```sh
import os
from sportsbot.datasets import read_data

dir_path = 'multi_labeled_split_datasets/'

data = read_data(dir_path+"specific_file_name")
```

Each `Conversation` object in the `data` list will have a fine-tuning template along with a list of labels. If the template is for question 1, conv.label[0] is the correct label and conv.label[-1] is the topic about which the quetsion is answered, conv.handle_tested is the person in the conversation about which the question is answered.

If it's fine-tuning data (...train.jsonl), the natural language label will be the last token of the template (see the main README for the label dictionary used for converting numeric labels to natural language, or the questions below).

```sh
for conv in data:
    print(conv.template)
    print(conv.label)
```
The labels and their natural language mappings for the five questions are below. Parentheticals contain how responses are hard coded and stored in the `label` field in each `Conversation` object. All responses are encoded as single tokens.

For more information on the labeling methadology, see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UYfLlOY5_peg9ZGkIYHlY-fb7qqenyE8ml8NaiiaX1E/edit)
