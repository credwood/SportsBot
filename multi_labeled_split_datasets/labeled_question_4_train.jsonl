Wasnt as close as the score says\\nEagles_Steelers: @BrianMi11423187 @philsfan34 @Ike58Reese They also gifted the steelers 21 points\\nBrianMi11423187: @Eagles_Steelers @philsfan34 @Ike58Reese Right so Ben didnt slice up the defense all damn day Right? Claypool didnt earn those tds the eagles gave them to him. Lol whatever you have to tell yourself...\\nEagles_Steelers: @BrianMi11423187 @philsfan34 @Ike58Reese The 1st PI wasnt PI the ball was overthrown and or was being thrown away, the 2nd PI was the receiver and CB getting their feet tangled basically ripped over each other and there was no replay on the Graham \\\"facemask\\\" and that fumble by Ebron was a fumble he turned up field\\nBrianMi11423187: @Eagles_Steelers @philsfan34 @Ike58Reese Wow you should really take that Steelers logo out of your pic. To say that ebron play was a fumble is just insane. AND YOUR COMPLETELY GLOSSING OVER AN ACTUAL TD THEY TOOK OFF THE BOARD FROM CLAYPOOL\\nEagles_Steelers: @BrianMi11423187 @philsfan34 @Ike58Reese Maybe if you could read you'd see what my profile pic said and Ebron made the catch 2 feet then turned when he was hit = a fumble but somehow the refs called it a interception on the field for who knows why. And even if they gave the td to Claypool its still 14 points gifted\\n\\n--\\nQuestion: At any point in this conversation, is Ike58Reese sarcastic?\\nAnswer: No\", \"handle_tested\": \"Ike58Reese\", \"model_statistics\": []}"
