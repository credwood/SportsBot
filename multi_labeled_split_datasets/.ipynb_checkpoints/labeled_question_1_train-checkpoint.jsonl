Lol whatever you have to tell yourself...\\nEagles_Steelers: @BrianMi11423187 @philsfan34 @Ike58Reese The 1st PI wasnt PI the ball was overthrown and or was being thrown away, the 2nd PI was the receiver and CB getting their feet tangled basically ripped over each other and there was no replay on the Graham \\\"facemask\\\" and that fumble by Ebron was a fumble he turned up field\\nBrianMi11423187: @Eagles_Steelers @philsfan34 @Ike58Reese Wow you should really take that Steelers logo out of your pic. To say that ebron play was a fumble is just insane. AND YOUR COMPLETELY GLOSSING OVER AN ACTUAL TD THEY TOOK OFF THE BOARD FROM CLAYPOOL\\nEagles_Steelers: @BrianMi11423187 @philsfan34 @Ike58Reese Maybe if you could read you'd see what my profile pic said and Ebron made the catch 2 feet then turned when he was hit = a fumble but somehow the refs called it a interception on the field for who knows why. And even if they gave the td to Claypool its still 14 points gifted\\n\\n--\\nQuestion: Does Ike58Reese like the Steelers?\\nAnswer: Remote\", \"handle_tested\": \"Ike58Reese\", \"model_statistics\": []}"
