That was immediately apparent.\\nJopatmc1967: @RedNinetyFour The Westbrook trade was direct evidence of Harden's control of Morey and the front office.  Morey let that happen.   He didn't reign Harden back.   There's a long history of non- transactions that Harden cancelled and transactions that Harden forced on the team.  \\n\\n1/\\nJopatmc1967: @RedNinetyFour Morey is directly responsible for constantly pandering to Harden and never reigning him in.  And Harden is directly responsible for his failures in the playoffs.   Harden has had it all his way during the Morey years. And none of that has anything to do with Fertitta.\\n\\n2/\\nJopatmc1967: @RedNinetyFour Fertitta inherited the Harden/Morey dynamic and had to work with it or else come in and blow it up as the new owner and be hated 10 times more than he is now. Fertitta was stuck with trying to appease a pampered Harden with Westbrook to win favor in the community. \\n\\n3/\\nJopatmc1967: @RedNinetyFour Morey knew it was a bad move and he shared that with Fertitta.  It was the culmination of years of giving in to Harden.  Now tough decisions need to be made.  And the best way to bring them about was to cut the string between Morey and Harden.  Morey understood that. \\n\\n4/\\nJopatmc1967: @RedNinetyFour So Morey cut the strings at a convenient time for him,  giving himself a one- year hiatus while already having another job locked up.   (This will come out in the future.)\\n\\nAnd the Rockets are left with a decision on Harden and Westbrook.   \\n\\n5/\\nJopatmc1967: @RedNinetyFour Harden is eligible to sign an extension right now for an additional 2 seasons.
